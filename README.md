# monolith

A data hoarder's dream come true: bundle any web page into a single HTML file.  
You can finally replace that gazillion of open tabs with a gazillion of .html files stored somewhere on your precious little drive.

Unlike conventional "Save page asâ€¦", `monolith` not only saves the target document,
it embeds CSS, image, and JavaScript assets **all at once**, producing a single HTML5 document that is a joy to store and share.

If compared to saving websites with `wget -mpk`, `monolith` embeds all assets as data URLs and therefore displays the saved page exactly the same, being completely separated from the Internet.

<!-- `This program works both on remote and local targets. -->
