summary: Monolith - Save HTML pages with ease 
description: |
  A data hoarder's dream come true: bundle any web page into a single
  HTML file. You can finally replace that gazillion of open tabs with
  a gazillion of .html files stored somewhere on your precious little
  drive.
  Unlike conventional "Save page asâ€¦", monolith not only saves the
  target document, it embeds CSS, image, and JavaScript assets all
  at once, producing a single HTML5 document that is a joy to store
  and share.
  If compared to saving websites with wget -mpk, monolith embeds
  all assets as data URLs and therefore displays the saved page
  exactly the same, being completely separated from the Internet.
